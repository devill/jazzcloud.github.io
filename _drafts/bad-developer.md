Nobody thinks he is a bad developer. Everybody does its best. At least let's assume it.

But even if person tries to do its best, it doesn't mean that result will be exceptional, or at least satisfactory.

It happens for obvious reasons. People doesn't know about the things they don't know. 

For example, imagine person who knows how to build web-application with Rails, and he is really good at it, but at the same time he don't know about SOLID principles, why they exist, and what problems prevent?
And it is not very imaginary situation actually - I used to be such person myself some time ago.

I didn't avoided all that architecture stuff intentionally. I opened books about architecture patterns, I watched videos from conferences, read blog-posts. 
In some cases I was thinking that this all is irrelevant to my situation - I have best language and web-framework in the world, so these are the problems from another world. And we - rails-developers don't even need to know about this kind of stuff, cause we don't have such problems.
In other situations I was agree with speakers or authors that they speak about something, which is very right. But again, I had no clue how to apply it to my own code.

The problem was that this knowledge was counter-intuitive for me.

In ideal situation there should be a person(a teacher, a guru, a mentor), who will be able not even to teach you, but at least explain you why it is important.

But situation is not always ideal. So, you might be doing your best, but still producing bad code.

Does it mean that I was bad developer?

Of course, we should answer the question here, what is bad code. Bad code is non-scaleable code. And I don't even mean ability to launch your app on cluster. I mean ability of not loosing development speed when your app grows.

Good news is that your customer understanding of what is good code is not ideal. So at his current point he can be pretty happy with your bad code. And both of you might be very proud of your bad code, until day X. 

It is good, because it means that you have buffer where you can learn. Ideally
