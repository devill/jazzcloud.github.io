There is one thing about learning that annoys me.
Once you learned something, it now looks obvious for you.
And you start to think that it doesn't worth to tell anybody about it, because you think that it is obvious for other people too.

But even if you share your story, you often use that new terminology, you just learned, which is not understandable for guys who did not go through that way yet. So you might be appreciated by other experienced guys and they kinda accept you into club, but that's it - you are not able to pass that knowledge to people who actually need it.

If you want to teach somebody, you should try to remember the terms in which you were thinking previously and tell your story using this terms. You might look a little bit dumb for experienced guys, but less experienced will appreciate it.

Thanks.
