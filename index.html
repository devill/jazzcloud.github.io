<h1 class='entry-title'>Competencies</h1>
<h2>Backends</h1>

<p>The heart of your backend is business logic. To survive in constantly changing conditions(i.e. real world), your business logic code should be lean.</p>
<p>Ideally the core shouldn't care about persistence, interaction with other services and it should have minimum of dependencies. It should be well-tested and all possible ways to use it should be documented.</p>
<p>Once you achieved it, you can switch storage, payment services provider or any other 3rd party service to another one with ease.</p>
<p>And we want you to have such code. And this is kind of code, we're writing.</p>

</p>


<h2>Refactoring</h1>
<p>There's a huge amount of companies suffering from their current codebase. Busines wants to add new features rapidly, but development can't, because existing code is too complicated and fragile. At this point no innovation is possible anymore, and this is not good.</p>

<p>You already paid a lot to develop your product. Now it is time to invest in architecture, quality and all those things, which you ignored while you main focus was growth.

</p>

<h2>APIs</h1>
<p>There's no chance, you can write an application, which does not care about interaction with the world. Either you're going to consume some API, or you had to provide one. We can help you with both.</p>

<h1 class='entry-title'>Our approach</h1>

<h2>Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not to put new dependency until there's more simple way to solve your problem.</li>
<li>Follow SOLID smartly</li>
<li>Prefer set of micro-apps with single responsibilities over one monolithic app</li>
</ul>

<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>It is much simpler to build simple software with simple tools! We believe in power of simplicity, and ruby ecosystem provides lots of great simple libraries and tools. </p>

<h2>Ruby on Rails?</h2>
<p>«The main thing you need to know about Rails is when not to use it». We know.</p>
<p>Ruby on Rails has kind of compromised reputation. The complexity of the framework has bad influence on applications written using Rails. We prefer not to use Rails/ActiveRecord as a core of application where it's possible.</p>


<h2>Tools and libraries</h2>
Just some of our favorites:

<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Sequel</li>
<li>Sinatra</li>
<li>Virtus</li>
<li>Sidekiq</li>
<li>Minitest</li>
</ul>
