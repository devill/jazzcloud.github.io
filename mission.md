Our main goal is to help companies to build sustainable backends for their products.

# Backends
The heart of your backend is business logic. To survive in constantly changing conditions, your business logic code should be very lean. Ideally the core doesn't care about persistence, interaction with 3rd party services and it should have minimum of dependencies.
It is well-testd and all possible ways to use it are well documented.
Once you have it, you can switch storage, payment services provider or any other 3rd-party service to another one with ease.
And we want you to have such code. And this is kind of code, we're writing.

# APIs
There's no chance, you can write an application, which does not care about interaction with the world. Either you're going to consume some API, or you had to provide one. We can help you with both.


# Refactoring
There's a huge amount of companies suffering from their current codebase. They want to add new features rapidly, but they can't, because existing code is too complicated and fragile. This is the point where you stop to innovate, and this is really bad.

You already paid a lot to develop your product. Now it is time to invest in architecture, quality and all those things, which were ignored by your team for years.
